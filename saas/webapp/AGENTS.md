# Web Application - Agent Instructions

This folder contains the context and documentation for the **Web Application** project.

## Your Knowledge Base
The `docs/` folder is your primary source of truth. Before starting any task:
1.  **Search** the `docs/` folder for relevant context.
2.  **Read** the `1_product_context.md` to understand the goal.
3.  **Update** the docs if you make architectural decisions or changes.

## Documentation Structure
- `1_product_context.md`: What we are building (PRD, User Flows).
- `2_system_architecture.md`: How we build it (Tech stack, Database, High-level Arch).
- `3_backend_api.md`: Server-side details, API contracts, Integration.
- `4_frontend_client.md`: Client-side details, UI Components, State Management.
- `5_security_ops.md`: Security, Deployment, Maintenance.
- `6_testing_qa.md`: Testing strategy.

## Guidelines
- Follow the **Architecture** defined in `2_system_architecture.md`.
- Ensure **Security** practices from `5_security_ops.md` are applied in every code change.
- Keep `1_product_context.md` updated as requirements evolve.
