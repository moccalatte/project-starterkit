# Project Context

**Stop. Don't fill this template until you can answer one question: What problem are you actually solving?**

## The Real Problem
**What specific pain do specific people have that keeps them awake at 3am?**

Not "users want better experience." That's meaningless. Try: "Small business owners lose $2,000/month because they can't track inventory across 3 locations and discover shortages only when customers complain."

## Who Gives a Damn
**Who has this problem RIGHT NOW and would pay money to solve it?**

Be brutally specific:
- Demographics that matter
- Context where pain occurs  
- How they currently fail to solve it
- Why they haven't found alternatives

## Your Approach
**What's the simplest thing that could possibly work?**

Not your grand vision. Not the platform you'll build eventually. The MVP that proves people will actually use this.

## Success = Money/Usage/Survival
**How do you know you haven't built something nobody wants?**

Define metrics that matter:
- Revenue (if applicable)
- Active usage (not signups)
- User retention (not acquisition)
- Problems actually solved (not features shipped)

## Technology Constraints
**What are you actually building this with and why?**

List real constraints:
- Team skills
- Time limits
- Budget reality
- Integration requirements

**Warning**: If you can't fill this out specifically, you're not ready to build anything. Go talk to real people with real problems first.
