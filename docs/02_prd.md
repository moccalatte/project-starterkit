# Product Requirements

**If you can't explain why someone would pay for this, stop building it.**

## Core Value Proposition
**What do users get that they can't get anywhere else?**

One sentence. No buzzwords. No "synergistic solutions." Just value.

## Critical User Journey
**The ONE flow that must work perfectly or your business dies.**

### Primary Flow:
1. User arrives with [specific problem]
2. System delivers [specific solution] 
3. User achieves [specific measurable outcome]
4. User [pays/returns/recommends] because [specific value]

**Success Metric**: [Specific number] users complete this flow within [timeframe]

## Non-Negotiable Requirements

### Business Critical
- **Data Integrity**: [Specific data] must never be lost/corrupted
- **Security**: [Specific assets] protected from [specific threats]
- **Performance**: [Critical actions] complete in under [specific time]
- **Compliance**: [Specific regulations] for [specific data/money]

### User Experience
- **Core Flow**: Works on [specific devices/browsers]
- **Error Handling**: Users understand what went wrong and how to fix it
- **Recovery**: Users can undo/retry critical actions

## What We're NOT Building

List features that seem related but don't serve the core value:
- [Feature that sounds good but doesn't solve core problem]
- [Complex feature that can wait for v2]
- [Nice-to-have that doesn't drive user behavior]

**Why This Matters**: Saying no to good ideas enables yes to great execution.

## Launch Criteria
**When is this ready for real users?**

- [ ] Core flow works end-to-end
- [ ] Users can recover from common mistakes
- [ ] System survives peak expected load
- [ ] Business-critical data is protected
- [ ] You can support users when things break

## Metrics That Matter
**How do you know this is working?**

- **Usage**: [Specific user actions] per [timeframe]
- **Value**: [Business metric] improvement after [timeframe]
- **Adoption**: [Percentage] of target users complete core flow
- **Retention**: [Percentage] return after [timeframe]

**Anti-Metrics**: Vanity metrics that feel good but don't indicate success
