## What You Get

**Essential Templates**:
- [00_context.md](docs/00_context.md) — Define the real problem you're solving
- [01_dev_protocol.md](docs/01_dev_protocol.md) — 3 fatal gates to prevent business death
- [02_prd.md](docs/02_prd.md) — Requirements that matter, not wishlist features
- [03_architecture_plan.md](docs/03_architecture_plan.md) — Systems that survive failure
- [04_dev_tasks.md](docs/04_dev_tasks.md) — Sprint-based delivery, not endless planning
- [05_security_policy.md](docs/05_security_policy.md) — Threat-based security, not theater
- [06_risk_audit.md](docs/06_risk_audit.md) — Business-killing risks, not imaginary ones
- [07_quality_review.md](docs/07_quality_review.md) — Definition of done that ships
- [08_release_notes.md](docs/08_release_notes.md) — Changes that matter to users
- [09_maintenance_plan.md](docs/09_maintenance_plan.md) — Operations that work at 3am
- [agents.md](docs/agents.md) — AI problem-solving, not bureaucracy

## How to Use This Kit

### Quick Start
1. **Copy these templates** to your new project directory
2. **Fill out the context** - Define the real problem you're solving
3. **Use the AI prompts** - Problem-focused development instead of template filling
4. **Ship working software** - Focus on solving user problems, not perfect documentation

### Template Purpose
Each template helps you avoid common startup failures:

| Template | Prevents |
|----------|----------|
| Context | Building something nobody wants |
| PRD | Feature creep and scope bloat |  
| Architecture | Technical debt and system failures |
| Dev Tasks | Analysis paralysis and missed deadlines |
| Security | Data breaches and regulatory violations |
| Risk Audit | Business-killing blind spots |
| Quality | Production disasters and user abandonment |
| Release Notes | User confusion and poor communication |
| Operations | 3am emergencies and system failures |
| Agents | AI bureaucracy and ineffective collaboration |

## AI-First Development Process

**Step 1 – Problem Definition**
```
I need to solve [SPECIFIC PROBLEM] for [SPECIFIC USERS] who currently [SPECIFIC PAIN POINT]. 
Build me the simplest solution that delivers [SPECIFIC OUTCOME] with these constraints: [REAL CONSTRAINTS].
Focus on working code first, documentation second.
```

**Step 2 – Risk Analysis**
```
What could kill this business? Focus on fraud, security breaches, and data loss. 
Design defenses for the top 3 threats. Show me working security implementations.
Reference `01_dev_protocol.md` for fatal gate requirements.
```

**Step 3 – Production Readiness**
```
Make this production-ready: database integrity, monitoring, rollback procedures. 
Show me the disaster recovery plan that actually works.
Test failure scenarios and document recovery steps.
```

**Step 4 – User Validation**
```
Test this with real users. What breaks? What's missing? What would make them pay?
Build feedback loops and iterate based on actual usage, not assumptions.
```

**Step 5 – Scale Planning**
```
If this gets 10x users tomorrow, what breaks first? Fix the bottlenecks.
Design for the load you'll actually have, not theoretical perfection.
```

## Philosophy

### ultraThink Principles
- **Think Different**: Question every assumption, start from first principles
- **Craft, Don't Code**: Every solution should feel inevitable and elegant  
- **Simplify Ruthlessly**: Remove complexity without losing power
- **Ship Working Software**: Focus on solving real problems, not perfect engineering

### Anti-Patterns This Kit Prevents
❌ **Analysis Paralysis**: 13 documents before writing line 1 of code
❌ **Template Worship**: Mistaking documentation for planning
❌ **Security Theater**: Complex rules that don't prevent actual threats
❌ **Bureaucratic AI**: Rigid workflows that slow down development

✅ **Problem-First Development**: Start with user pain, end with working solutions

## Quick Start Template

**Copy this prompt to start any new project:**

```
I need to solve [SPECIFIC PROBLEM] for [SPECIFIC USERS] who currently [PAIN POINT].

Requirements:
- Reference the AI-First Development Kit templates
- Follow the 3 fatal gates: Security, Data Integrity, Operations  
- Build working MVP that proves the concept
- Focus on shipping value, not perfect engineering

Generate the essential project files and start building.
```

## Success Metrics

### Project Health Indicators
- **User Adoption**: Real users completing core workflows
- **Business Value**: Measurable improvement in user outcomes
- **System Reliability**: Uptime and error rates within acceptable ranges
- **Team Velocity**: Consistent delivery of working features

### Warning Signs
- More time on documentation than user problems
- Perfect engineering with no user validation
- Complex processes that slow down shipping
- Security rules that don't map to actual threats
